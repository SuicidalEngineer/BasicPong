# BasicPong
 You're probably expecting something inovative. Then this game is not it. This is just a basic game created with turtle graphics. I'm pretty sure you know thee rest.

 Pong is a multiplayer game which includes a ball and 2 paddles that you send the ball right back at your friend. You control the left paddle with W, S keys and the left paddle with Up and Down keys. You just write a score at the beginning to be able win eventually and you start having fun, i hope, and playing.
 
 HAVE FUN!
